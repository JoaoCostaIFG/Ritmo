# Ritmo

Ritmo is a simple, lightweight, and easy to use music bot for Discord. It is my attempt
at making a music bot that just works and isn't constantly asking for donations or
subscriptions. It is completely free and open source.

## Features

- Play songs from YouTube (either by query or URL);
- Add full playlists to the queue;
- Manage the queue;
- Autoplay on queue end based on the last songs played;
- Fairly well organized codebase, so it is easy to add new commands.
